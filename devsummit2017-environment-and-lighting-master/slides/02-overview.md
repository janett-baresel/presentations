# Overview

</br></br>

- time & date
- stars
- lights & shadow
- atmosphere
- quality profiles
- the road to enlightenment


note:
- first we'll look at how time and date influence the lighting and the other way around
- after that we'll have quick look at the stars in the sky
- followed by a closer look at lighting settings and how they affect the presentation of 3d objects
- we'll also look at how the API visualizes the atmosphere of the earth, and how this influences our visualizations
- the last main topic are quality profiles which allow a tradeoff between quality and performance
- last but not least I'll give you an exclusive sneak peak at a relevant project we internally call "enlightenment"
